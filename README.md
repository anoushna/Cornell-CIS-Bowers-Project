For the Cornell Bowers website, I collaborated with three other web designers on a client-focused project as part of the same Design and Programming for the Web class. My sole responsibility was designing and developing the Home page, which is the only page I have included in the submission. Please note that other pages (Academics, Career, Staff) are not linked, as they were not part of my scope. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I implemented interactive features such as an image carousel and a responsive hamburger navigation button. This project provided valuable real-world experience in balancing client objectives with effective design, as well as working in a team environment. I also utilized GitHub for version control to ensure efficient collaboration and project management.
