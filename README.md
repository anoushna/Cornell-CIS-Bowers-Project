For the Cornell Bowers website, I collaborated with three other web designers on a client-focused project as part of the Design and Programming for the Web class. My primary responsibility was designing and coding the Home page and implementing the hamburger navigation menu. While I contributed to the overall design of the website and supported my teammates, I was not responsible for the coding of other pages (Academics, Career, Staff).

Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I developed interactive features such as an image carousel and a responsive navigation menu. As a team, we followed an accessibility checklist to ensure the website adhered to accessibility standards, enhancing usability for all users. This project provided valuable experience in balancing client objectives with effective design, collaborating in a team environment, and utilizing GitHub for version control to organize teamwork and project management.
